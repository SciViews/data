= data To Do list

* csvy

* header in .csv or .xls to define comment, labels, classes, etc.

* data_example() function

* make iris_short_header.csv, iris.csv.7z, iris.csvy, iris.csvy.zip,
  iris.sas7bdat and iris.syd working.

* The labelVector also defines a set_label() function, but differently and it
  does not handle units. Try to homogenize, and otherwise, change the name, to
  say, labellize().

* Look at fst package for ultra-fast csv read/write (+ data.table).

* write()

* Use a Github repository that provides scripts to translated datasets in
  different languages, and use it in read(...., lang = "xx").

* Integrate units with the convertr, prettyunits and units packages.
