# data To Do list

* Should we keep 'srcfile' for attribute of comment (not printed!)

* Rework data_raw script + translations by using labelise(self = FALSE)

* Do not label or change class (use data.frame) for initial dataset, but do it
  within read() with lang = argument + data_class = .

* Test for sidecar files.

* header in .csv or .xls to define comment, labels, classes, etc.

* data_example() function

* Add more datasets (plankton, ...).




* make iris_short_header.csv, iris.csv.7z, iris.csvy, iris.csvy.zip,
  iris.sas7bdat and iris.syd working: add foreign function.

* csvy

* Look at fst package for ultra-fast csv read/write (+ data.table).

* write() + keep it compatible with base::write()!

* Functions to write headers too: write -> read should restore same object!

* Use a Github repository that provides scripts to translated datasets in
  different languages, and use it in read(...., lang = "xx").

* Integrate units with the convertr, prettyunits and units packages.

* A smaller example for read(), and detail all the cases in a vignette instead.

* revdep, see for instance, https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13

* about(), .? and the dataframe methods to be placed somewhere.
